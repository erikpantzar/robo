# Robots
Feels really weird having the Y-axis inverted. Number going UP when moving downwards.

## Vanilla
Did a class for the first Robot, and some methods to move around and set direction etc.
Quite pleased with what I came up with how to change direction actually, really feels like a compass!

## MVC: Anguluar(1.5.8) Robot Component
Same methods as in vanilla robot just in a angular component architecture


## Tests
Both tests are on <version>.spec.html and runs the scenarios given in the assignment.
